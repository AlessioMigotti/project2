## Creation Process  
  
### **1. Strategy**  


- I required an easy-to-read, dependable website that delivers clear information about what the survey does.  
- Logo of the website must be visible and social media links available.  
- The retro aesthetic of Free Quantifier is to be carried on throughout the website with the use of consistent, clean design and use of graphics and colour to evoke an emotional and calm connection for the user.  
- Explenation within the landing page is to be transparent and simple.  
- Mobile responsiveness is an essential feature required for this website.
  

### **2. Scope**  

The Free Quantifier site must be available on a wide range of devices due to the varied range of customer ages. A large portion of their client base is liberals, over-20 age group, comprising mostly of hippies bringing their questions out for a quick answer. Free Quantifier provides a comfortable, no-fuss environment in the website.  

- The site is to contain only essential information, presented in a similar fashion and layout.   
- Text must be clear and legible on any sized device to allow the user instant access to the survey.  
- A brief description of the website is to be included on the landing page.  
- For future development, an ordering system for psycological requests will be included. Also, a large gallery page featuring images of shots of customers and staff.
  

### **3. Structural**  

Similar to the idea for the design and layout to be accessible and functional, simple navigation and interactivity were essential. The site needed to provide information swiftly no matter the age of the user.  
- Easy to identify, clickable links with a consistent layout. The design was to be predictable for each page with the information clearly identifiable.  
- Any buttons had to provide to the user to identify their score in the form of a design change that followed the flow of the overall aesthetic.  
- A large, clear button to bring the user directly to the menu would be placed front and center of their eye-line.  
- In addition, the navigation logo and footer would be visible on every page, at every device size, displaying the same information. This would provide the returning customer with a faster route to their information destination, strengthening the site's familiar and trusting feeling.  

  
### **4. Skeleton**  

The site was developed to be simple, clear, and familiar.  

- For the landing page, the logo, Free Quantifier, was to be top-center of every page, no matter the orientation or screen size.  
- The simple, item navigation logo of will take you to the index, is situated always to the top-center of the page.  
- A large, clear image dominates the landing page.  
- Centered in the page is a intoduction with a large, clickable button situated immediately below it. First-time visitors have access to the survey with one easy click.  
- The page ends with the footer, again offering four pieces of important information to the user, Copyright, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.  

- For the survey page, the navigation logo and footer remain as before. Between these lies the survey items laid out in identifiable, headed sequential sections. Question from the most brilliant minds in the freedom phyilosophy intersected with the expetise of comportamental analyst that created the questions and option following the CBT (Cognitive behavioral therapy). That have a multiple answer choice, where one has to be selected to proceed to the next question.  
  
- For the results, the navigation and footer remain as before. One section is presented with explanatory headings. An optional selection for visitors who wish to get a clearer view of the graph, an interactive legend within the frame.   

### Wireframes

</details> 
           

### **5. Surface**  

 A design was created that allowed a consistent flow throughout the two-page site.   
 - On the landing page the background was designed to reflect the surveys frame used by the Free Quantifier website.   
- A palette of green, red and black was created, to inspire calmess.   
- Corners on all button elements are rounded to maintain a retro feel. 

Overall, the design was intended and created to foster the emotional and familiar connection customers have with freedom.

## Design  

### **Color Scheme**  

This website used a fresh, bold palette of whites and greens to capture the aesthetic of a traditional survey. The colours reminded me of calmness and freedom. I combined these with an black text and red graph line that felt clean.  
  
![colour theme swatches](assets/images/Screenshot%20(56).png)  
  

  

  
[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) provided this fantastic resource for checking how accessible your colours are. I submitted my palette to the [Color Blind Safe](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility) check to find they passed this test also.

### **Typography**

![Site map on Miro](assets/images/Screenshot%20(76).png)

### **Imagery**  
  
The images that I have chosen for my site reflect the bright, retro aesthetic I am looking for. Close-ups of large displays of a landscape create a positive feeling for the user, prompting them to delve further into the suvey section. A large image sits on top the explation and survey, it shows the art of one of the most creative mind of this century Guido Migotti. The app [sketchbook](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sketchbook/id883738213) was used to drow it, with the use of an ipad and a digital pen used throughout the art.  Attributions to the artist are placed in the [Credits](#credits) section of this README doc.

## Future Features  

- For future development, I would like to include an ordering system on the website to allow customers to order menu items for takeaway and a form element for larger orders to cater for parties and events.  
- An embedded video of the in-house ice cream production, showing customers how to make ice cream from beginning to end.
- A gallery page of dessert specials, events held at the parlour, and candid photos of customers and staff.

### **Initial testing plan**

I had planned for this site to be accessible and legible on all screen sizes. The user is viewing the site primarily for the menu options and parlour location and they needed to access this information with one click.

- Acer Aspire 3 Laptop (1920 X 1080)  
- EliteDisplay E201 24" Monitor
- iPad Pro 2021
- iPhone SE(2016)
- Huawei p30 Lite 
- iPhone 11/13
- Samsung Galaxy s10 
  
### **Testing**    

Testing took place throughout the entire build using Dev Tools on Chrome and on the above real-world devices. The browsers used were:  
- Chrome   
- Safari
